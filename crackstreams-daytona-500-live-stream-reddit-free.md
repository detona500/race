The Daytona Duels on Thursday night solidified the rest of the field, including which of the uncharted teams will take part in the Great American Race. Could Jimmie Johnson or Denny Hamlin add to their Daytona trophy case Sunday? Well, we hope the race will be Sunday as we keep an eye on the weather forecasts. Rain moved last year's Daytona 500 to Monday, and this year's start time has already changed.

Austin Cindric wins Daytona Duel No. 2
Following a video review by NASCAR, Team Penske driver Austin Cindric was declared the winner of Duel No. 2 over Legacy Motor Club driver Erik Jones. Cindric, in the No. 2 Ford, and Jones, in the No. 43 Toyota, took the checkered flag at seemingly the same time, but because a caution flag was thrown less than a second before, NASCAR had to review which driver was leading when the yellow flag waved.

Cindric was already locked into the front row of Sunday's Daytona 500 after finishing second behind pole winner Chase Briscoe in Wednesday's pole qualifying. But his win in Duel No. 2 will generate extra regular-season points. With his second-place finish, Jones sewed up the No. 4 starting spot in the 67th annual Daytona 500.
